# CS4632_DiseaseSpreadSimulation
# CS4632 Disease Spread Simulation

Semester project for CS4632.  
Implements an SIR/SEIR-based simulation of infectious disease spread in a population.  

## Planned Features
- Simulation of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered states
- Probabilistic infection and recovery
- Intervention strategies (vaccination, quarantine)
- Metrics collection (epidemic curves, peak infection, outbreak duration)

## Project Structure
- `/src` — Java source files (to be added)
- `/docs` — UML diagrams and project documentation
- `README.md` — project overview
- `.gitignore` — Java build artifacts excluded
